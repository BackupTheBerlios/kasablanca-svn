kio-ftps 0.3, Magnus Kulke 2008, licensed under GPL Version 2 or later.

This kio slave implements the ftp encryption scheme called ftps, based on 
rfc 4217. The slave tries to use all the encryption the server offers.
This kio slave is used by kasablanca, but you can it in other kde apps
like konqueror and dolphin too.  

It currently supports: 

- Control channel encryption.
- Encrypted PASV & PORT data transfers.

It still lacks: 

- Authentification via client certificate.
